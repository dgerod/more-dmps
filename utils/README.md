List of modules:
* pdt: primitive data-types.
* rbag: module to load ROS bags.
* stg: simple trajectory generator

The *pdt* and *rbag* modules are used to load/save trajectories (Cartesian and PTP) from/to ROS bags. 
Although *rbag* is only working with trajectories, it could be extended to load/save other bags by injecting message importers and exporters.
